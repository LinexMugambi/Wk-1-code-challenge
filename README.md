# Grade calculator
This program calculates student scores and grades them if the student gets above 79 the grade returned is A,if the student gets above 60 and below 79 the grade returned  is B,if the student gets above 49 and below 59 the drade returned is C,if the student gets above 40 and below 49 the grade returned is D,and if students gets below 40 the grade returned is E.

# speed limit detector
This software accepts a speed input and, depending on how fast it is, either produces an alright result or, if the speed exceeds the speed limit, returns demerit points. The program suspends the license if the speed reaches or surpasses 130, at which point 12 demerit points will have been earned.

To ensure that the return value for demerit points is always an integer, I implemented a bracket system for demerit points in the Speed Detector application. As an illustration, a speed input of 71 should return 0.2 demerit points, whereas a speed input of 74 should return 0.8, but both return 1.

# Net Salary Calculator
This program takes an input of the basic salary as well as benefits and returns the net salary after decucting payments for NSSF, NHIF and PAYE. It also factors in personal relief
