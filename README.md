# Grade calculator

# speed limit detector
This software accepts a speed input and, depending on how fast it is, either produces an alright result or, if the speed exceeds the speed limit, returns demerit points. The program suspends the license if the speed reaches or surpasses 130, at which point 12 demerit points will have been earned.

To ensure that the return value for demerit points is always an integer, I implemented a bracket system for demerit points in the Speed Detector application. As an illustration, a speed input of 71 should return 0.2 demerit points, whereas a speed input of 74 should return 0.8, but both return 1.

# Net Salary Calculator
